My code solutions to 2018 edition of [AdventOfCode.com](https://AdventOfCode.com) problems

## Why C++?

After doing all the problems during the 2017 edition in Python, I wanted something different for this year. Hence C++ which is my primary language at work. The intended version is C++17 although I do not have the full compiler support on my favorite laptop (and I have not time for OS & compiler upgrade). Note that only standard libraries are required, there is no Boost dependency etc.

## Why share?

There are many ways to solve the problems, maybe others would like mine. Note however that I'm using C++ here for quick and dirty tasks, just like I would use a scripting language like Python. The time pressure does not allow me to make the best and greatest solution, but rather one that is satisfactory and works.

These amounts of autos and lambdas may be a hindrance to readability and I agree. On the other hand they help me to finish the task faster with less typing. STL algorithms reduce complexity.
