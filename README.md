My code solutions to 2018 edition of [AdventOfCode.com](https://AdventOfCode.com) problems

## Why C++?

After doing all the problems during the 2017 edition in Python, I wanted something different for this year. Hence C++ which is my primary language at work. The intended version is C++17 although I do not have the full compiler support on my favorite laptop (and I have not time for OS & compiler upgrade).

## Why share?

There are many ways to solve the problems, maybe others would like mine. Note however that I'm using C++ here for quick and dirty tasks, just like I would use a scripting language like Python. The time pressure does not allow me to make the best ang reatest solution, but rather one that is satisfactory and works.
